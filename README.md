# Car Detection with Artificial Neural Network

Rear-view vehicle detection using artificial neural network and hog features.


## Method

The project was made by the following steps:
1. Feature extraction
2. Network Training
3. Sliding Windows
4. Image Pyramid
5. Detection filtering
6. Results

### 1. Feature extraction
The select features are HOG.
### 2. Network Training
The project dataset consist in *9391* Vehicles images and *8493* non vechicle images, all of them in a size of 64x64 pixels.

The dataset was a combination of the both [GTI](https://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/data/Vehicle_database.html) and [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php?obj_benchmark=2d) Open datasets.
### 3. Sliding Windows
### 4. Image Pyramid
### 5. Detection filtering
This proccess was made by filter in the following steps
#### ANN values
#### Heatmap by Overlay
